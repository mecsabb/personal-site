Compile is an AI-powered news and media aggregator that curates articles based on user preferences and interests. It's pretty full of features and is something I had a lot of fun building with two of my friends. *At a glance we...*

- implemented a **custom Python web-scraping framework** on top of Crawl4AI, Stagehand, (and more)
- built an ingestion pipeline with **heirarchal clustering** and **theme-aware embeddings**
- tuned, prompt-optimized and context-managed ***lots* of LLMs** for the summaries
- built a **full-stack JavaScript** app for users to read, configure and explore articles
- setup a dev-box on my PC to schedule and manage pipelines with **Temporal**
- deployed it live at [compile-news.com](https://compile-news.com/) with Vercel
