In the summer of 2024 I was a Team Captain with Cohere Lab's Expedition Aya, an open-research effort to improve multilingual AI. I co-led a team of five other researchers around the world to develop a system to automatically detect mislabelled data in the Aya dataset. You can learn more about the Aya project [*here*](https://cohere.com/research/aya), and see our presentation slides [*here*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11XMf2NC9GaKLCiTGfZlrJjAJMuSW38-sExwVVOEVZg0/present?slide=id.g2f5d8fd911f_20_97). *At a glance we...*

- developed a system to detect mislabelled data in the **world's largest multilingual dataset**
- got to contribute to the development of the **state-of-the-art multilingual LLM**, Aya
- scheduled and coordinated meetings across ***six*** time zones (*...harder than you'd expect*)
