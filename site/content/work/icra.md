In my 4th year at Queen's I was fortunate to have the opportunity to write an undergraduate thesis supervised by Dr. Jonathan Gammell at the [Estimation, Search, and Planning Group](https://robotic-esp.com/). We worked on incremental planning, which is the problem of navigating a robot in an environment with changing information (e.g., dynamic or unknown obstacles). Check out the paper [*here*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21074) and the video [*here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaZrFy8wGZs). *At a glance we...*

- designed and developed a **state-of-the-art algorithm** for incremental planning
- wrote a *lot* of **C++** to visualize and benchmark different incremental planners
- developed ROS 2 nodes to **navigate Boston Dynamic's Spot autonomously** through Queen's campus
- authored and submitted a **paper to ICRA 2026**, the flagship and largest robotics conference in the world
