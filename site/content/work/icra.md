In my 4th year at Queen's I was fortunate to have the opportunity to write an undergraduate thesis supervised by Dr. Jonathan Gammell at the Estimation, Search, and Planning Group. We worked on incremental planning, which is the problem of getting a robot to navigate in an environment with changing on unknown obstacles. *At a glance we...*

- designed and developed a **state-of-the-art algorithm** for incremental planning
- wrote a *lot* of **C++** to visualize and benchmark different incremental planners
- developed ROS 2 nodes to **navigate Boston Dynamic's Spot autonomously** through Queen's campus
- authored and submitted a **paper to ICRA 2026**, the flagship and largest robotics conference in the world
