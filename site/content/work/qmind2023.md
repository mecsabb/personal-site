In my 3rd year of university I led my first QMIND project. We worked on a system to apply Alpha Zero, the state-of-the-art chess and Go bot, to currency trading. The setup for this is pretty awesome, and I want to write about it in the future, but you can check out an explanation [here](https://blog.skz.dev/arbitrage-as-a-shortest-path-problem). The idea was to use the training techniques from Alpha Zero (and a graph neural network) to find shortest-paths in a graph. *At a glance we...*
