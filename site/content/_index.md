### Hi, I'm Mitchell Sabbadini

I am a student, developer and researcher. I am in my last year of **Mathematics and Engineering** at Queen's University. I am interested in **machine learning and robotics**.

Over the past few years I've worked on quantitative trading desks, built [full-stack AI-agent apps](compile-news.com), trained ML models and written a [robotics research paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZX0GfLepZo5xsGW-rHZqBQwlzU80aAmx/view?usp=sharing). Most of my work has been with **Python and C++**. Recently I have been working on my full-stack **JavaScript** skills and web-design. 

Outside of work I enjoy listening to music, watching movies, working out, and playing squash. I also like learning new technologies (the grid is a tiny Rust package I wrote for WASM cellular automata).
