### Hi, I'm Mitchell Sabbadini

I am a student, developer and researcher. I am in my last year of **Mathematics and Engineering** at Queen's University. I am interested in **machine learning and robotics**.

Most of my work has been with **Python and C++**. Recently I have been working on my full-stack **JavaScript** skills and web-design. 

Outside of work I enjoy listening to music, watching movies, working out, and playing squash. I also like learning new technologies (the grid above is a WASM cellular automata simulation).
